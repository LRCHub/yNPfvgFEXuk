Not feeling so amazed
But doing alright
Unguarded and unfazed
But doing alright

Out of boredom
I decided I'd get with it

And it only hardened my wits
What of this
Unharnessed, that fits
What of this
And I started to imagine Appomattox

Well it's dull, brown and gray
Like all the things we do
That don't go away
